# DEPRECATED

This mod was based on Factorio 0.14, when aliens dropped artifacts for use in science recipes. This is no longer the case in the base game. I think some mods still include alien science drops (bob's mods?), feel free to use anything here for reference if you want to try bringing this idea to another mod, and ping me if you do! 

# Factorio Mod - Alien Waste Refining

This is somewhat of a rushed alpha release.  The Factorio team is removing alien research in their next major release, so I wanted to just get out something that works for people to try out.

## What does this mod do?

On killing unit spawners, resource patches containing alien waste are spawned.

These patches can be mined, and with the right technology researched, the alien waste can be refined into alien artifacts, that can be turned into alien research.
