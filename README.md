Factorio Mod - Alien Waste Refining
===================================

This is somewhat of a rushed alpha release.  The Factorio team is removing alien research in their next major release, so I wanted to just get out something that works for people to try out.

What does this mod do?
----------------------

On killing unit spawners, resource patches containing alien waste are spawned:

These patches can be mined, and with the right technology researched, the alien waste can be refined into alien artifacts, that can be turned into alien research.
